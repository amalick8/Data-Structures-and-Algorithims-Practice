# ðŸš€ Problem: Two Sum
#
# Given a list of integers nums and an integer target,
# return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#
# Assume:
# - There is always exactly one solution.
# - You cannot use the same element twice.
#
# Example 1:
# nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: [0, 1]
#
# Example 2:
# nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
# Output: [1, 2]
#
# ðŸ”‘ Hints:
# 1. Use two loops to check every pair (simple way).
# 2. Later, try using a dictionary for a faster solution.

nums = eval(input('Please type a list of numberes enclosed in [] and seperated with commas: '))
target = int(input('What number: '))
