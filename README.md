# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice 🚀

This repository contains my practice problems and solutions for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I’m using it to improve my problem-solving skills and strengthen my programming fundamentals.

---

## 📂 Structure
Each problem is saved as a separate Python file:

- `two_sum.py` → Classic Two Sum problem (array + indices).  
- `first_non-repeating_character.py` → Find the first unique character in a string.  
- *(more files will be added as I practice)*

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- Arrays & Lists  
- Strings  
- Hash Maps / Dictionaries  
- Loops & Conditionals  
- Problem-Solving Patterns

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of fundamental data structures.  
- Learn to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.  
- Track my progress as I work through different problems.
